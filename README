ConfigTable
===========
In Our project, we need to store some config data in mysql,like key-value data.
I create a cofig table to store these data,and the config model has set,get,drop method,
it's easy to read or write the config infomation.


Example
=======
ConfigTable.set 'charge_plan',{:min => 10, :max => 50}
ConfigTable.get 'charge_plan'

Installation
=======
git clone git@github.com:isamsam/config_table.git
